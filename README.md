# Credit Card Approval Prediction 💳

## Description 📝
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to classify credit card applicants as **"good"** or **"bad"** clients using machine learning techniques. The aim is to help financial institutions assess the creditworthiness of applicants efficiently.

### Key Insights 📈

#### Models Used 🤖
- **Logistic Regression & Random Forest**: Both models achieved high accuracy but were affected by **class imbalance**.

#### Model Performance 📊
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows a high number of correct predictions with minimal errors.
- **ROC Curve**: Near-perfect AUC, demonstrating strong predictive power.

#### Challenges & Improvements ⚙️
- **Class Imbalance**: The imbalance in the "good" and "bad" clients affected the learning process.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques like handling missing values and encoding improved the model's accuracy.

#### Enhancements 🔧
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized models for better performance.
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Applied to address class imbalance and improve the model's predictive ability.

## Technologies Used ⚙️
- **Python** 🐍: For machine learning and data preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn** 📚: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Pandas** 🐼: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy** 🔢: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** 📊: For visualizing model performance.
